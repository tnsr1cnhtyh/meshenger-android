Meshenger - an open-source P2P messenger

This app is thought to allow voice- as well as videocommunication
without any server, thus without the risk of anyone saving your data.
Also, the possible network throughput and ping are greatly optimized by such an approach.

The signaling, e.g. the exchange of neccessary information between devices is handled via a QR-Code,
which gets generated by one and scanned by the other device.

The Goal is to support IPv6 link-local adresses, thus minimizing the risk of a device suddenly
changing its address.
Also, webRTC should be used as a communication medium, offering audio and video transmission.
