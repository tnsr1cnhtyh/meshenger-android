Voice/Video calls on local networks.

Direct voice- and video phone calls without the need for accounts or access to the Internet.
There is no discovery mechanism, no meshing and no servers. Just scan each others QR-Code that will contain the contacts IP address.
This works at home or company networks but also in many off-the-grid networks such as community mesh networks.
