## Motivation
while big companies try to control the internet as much as possible,
individuals as well as smaller organizations often try to establish decentralized 
standards, which should provide a less-controlled, faster, and more independant internet.

As practical as this approach may seem, as of now there is only a small number of practical applications
which provide a serious alternative to established apps like WhatsApp, Facebook etc.
Thus, our goal was to create an open-source, decentralized messenger supporting audio- as well as videocalling through WebRTC,
that makes it as easy to add a contact as scanning a qr-code on another phone.

## Concept
Speaking about scanning qr-codes, lets shortly address the process a user has to go through
in order to establish a connection to another device.
Lets call our users Daniel and Anika.
Anika clicks a button in her app, which makes a qr-code appear on her screen:

![QR-Code Offer](./qr_offer.png)

Daniel in return clicks a second button on his phone, which respectively opens a scanner:

![QR-Code Scanner](./qr_scanner.png).

After the scanner has successfully scanned the code, the phones automatically exchange information like the username, 
the mac-address, the link-local-address if possible, the IPv4 address as a fallbask, making Daniel appear in Annikas contact list and vice versa.

In result, when one clicks the name of the other contact, the app tries to reach that contact through the saved address.
In case of failure the app tries to mutate that address considering its own network prefix and the mac-address of the target.
Is this connection established, a WebRTC-handshake is transmitted and finally a call is established using the WebRTC-PeerConnection etc. classes.

## WebRTC
WebRTC plays a huge role in the project, since one of the goals is to demonstrate a serverless use of WebRTC, 
basically establishing a connection between two devices without using a centralized server instance.
The reason this gets its own paragraph is the fact that all the major apps that utilize WebRTC use a centralized signalling server,
thus most of the available tutorials on WebRTC include such a server aswell.

Such a server basically acts as a messenger between nodes, delivering handshake-messages between the devices
as well as trying to establish a direct conenction between those devices.
Since our project is meant to be used mainly in closed networks and the nodes know every contacts address, there no need for such a server.

We hope our project could firstly act as proof of such a possibility, secondly as a motivation and maybe as a tutorial to similar projects.
